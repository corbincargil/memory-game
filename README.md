# Memory Game Project

## Description:

This memory game tests the player to see how many Better Call Saul characters they can keep track of, and was made using React.js. The goal of this project was to get comfortable using function components, state, and hooks in React. It was also good practice creating regular Javascript functions to manipulate sets of data (shuffling the card deck, adding more cards to the deck based on the round, etc.) and keeping the code clean and organized using ES6 modules.

### `Instructions:`
1) Click on as many character cards in a row as you can without clicking on any of them more than once. 
2) Each time a card is clicked, the deck is shuffled.
3) Every 5 points, a new round is started and 5 more character cards are added to the deck. 
4) Can you get to the end of the deck by completing all 6 rounds and clicking on 30 characters in a row? Give it a shot! 

## Lessons Learned: 
* Solidified fundaments of using hooks to pass state between function components based on user interactions (current score, round #, hi-score, adding cards to the deck, etc.)
* Practice writing clean, organized code across multiple folders/files in a way that is easy for others to read and understand
* Further practice implementing ES6 Modules
* Building a React project from scratch and creating function components


## Project Features: 

* Deck shuffles after any card is clicked
* Scoreboard at the top tracks the current score, round #, and the high score
* New round started every 5 points, for a total of 6 rounds
